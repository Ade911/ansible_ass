step 1 
create ec2 instances
- one linux ec2 (controller)
- second linux-node
- third windows-node (on the security group set a new inbound rule 
WinRm-HTTPS to allow port 5986 open)

step 2
ssh into the controller

step 3
install ansible in the controller
sudo amazon-linux-extras install-ansible2 -y

step 4 
check ansible version
ansible --version

Step 5 
Install pywinrm module
sudo yum install pip
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pip==9.0.3 
pip install pywinrm

Step 6
Edit the inventory file for Ansible
cd /etc/ansible
ls -l
Edit hosts
vi hosts

[windows]
<input server IP> ensure to use the private IP

[windows:vars]

ansible_user=ansadmin
ansible_password=icui4cusunday1$
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_port=5986
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore

Step 7
Install WINRM on windows
- log into the windows instance
- download the powershell script called ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 in the C drive on the windows server
-open cmd as administrator (still on windows server)
-To install the Windows Remote Management package, Enter the command below
cd \
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1

Step 8
Based on the configuration file above, set your username to ansadmin and set your ansible_password
Still on WindowsPress windows_logo + R, then input 
compmgmt.msc
click Local User and Groups
Click Users
THEN create new user to be ansadmin then ansible_password
uncheck user must change password at next login
Then click create
- Ensure to make the user member of administrator (else, you wont be able to make commands from your ansible controller)
- Right click on the newly created ansadmin, click on properties, click Member pf Administrator, then click add
Inside the box below, type administrators, then click check names, then click ok, apply, ok

Step 9
Ping your windows from controller 
ansible all -m win_ping
Further check the connections
ansible all -m win_command -a "whoami.exe"
ansible all -m win_command -a "cmd.exe /c mkdir c:\test"
ansible all -m win_command -a "cmd.exe /c mkdir c:\trevotech-Devops"

How to connect to Linux node
Step 1: 
ssh into your node

Step 2 
go to root
sudo su -

Step 3 (to modify the congfig file)
cd /etc/
ls
cd ssh/
ls
vi sshd_config
edit passwordauthentication to (yes)
then set password
passwd tap Enter then set your password

Step 4 
Go to the controller node ssh with the private ip, password will be required, input your newly setted password then you should be able to ssh into your node

Step 5
To have a more secure way to connect to your node from the controller, you must access it via ssh, so you have to generate keypair

ON CONTROLLER
ssh-keygen (you will receive a prompt, tap Enter all through to make it default) (on the controller)
Now both public and private key would have been created

ls -a
cd .ssh/
ls
cd .ssh/

NOTE: We have to store the public key generated on the controller on the node
ssh-copy-id <node-private-ip eg 172.31.25.185>, then enter the password created initially

NOW  go to your node 
sudo su -
ls -a
you will see .ssh file been created
on the controller cat your public key   cat id_rsa.pub
on the node cat authorised key          cat authorized_keys   [you will see the ip address of your controller]

NOW 
Go to node and edit the config file back passwordauthentication to NO


cd /etc/ssh/
ls
vi sshd_config 
edit passwordauthentication to (no)
